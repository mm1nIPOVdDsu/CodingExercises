# CodingExercises

Solution was given to me with the request that I optimize the main project to help compensate for 3000ms delay built into the code. I created the Common, Data, Domain, and Services projects to make, among other things, testing easier. I went the route of DDD so I created a mapping service ONLY IN CONCEPT...using reflection in this way shouldn't be done. Dependency injection is handled by Unity...not the best, not the worst. The main purpose of this example is to show the DI/DDD pattern that I've used in the past with success.
